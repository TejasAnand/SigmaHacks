A study by EWG notes that a woman applies about 168 different chemicals everyday. This exposure accumulates over time and so it is important for people to opt for products that are cleaner and better for our health. Because the FDA does not regulate skincare, almost any ingredient can be incorporated in formula, some of them being super dangerous to your health. A lot of ingredients found in traditional skincare products (face washes, lotions, sunscreen, etc) have now been linked to health issues such as allergies, eczema, cancer, hormonal disruption, and reproductive problems. In a separate piece of alarming research, it showed that the skin absorbs up to 60% of the chemicals in products. They then come into direct contact with the bloodstream. What we put on our skin should be as clean as what we eat, but most people are unaware of the situation. Even when using small amounts of the product, many of the chemicals commonly found can have tremendous health and hormonal impact, and we are a long way from understanding the consequences.
